<h2>Task 1 - Release the displayName attribute to your SP</h2>

<p>
Have a look in attribute-filter.xml.j2, where you will find an entry for releasing the mail attribute to an SP. Add an additional entry for displayName and redeploy.
</p>

<p>
Go the SP (https://192.168.33.88) and click on the "Login via UbuntuNet Alliance (unIDa)" link. Make sure you see the displayName attribute.
